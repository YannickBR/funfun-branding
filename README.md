To update the sponsors:

1. Add sponsors to the directory.
2. Add a link to the sponsor's website in the `sponsor_links.json` file with the sponsor's name as the key (and the same as the image name)
3. Login to the hostinger account and upload the images to the `sponsors` directory. (/domains/corsogroepfunfun.nl/public_html/wp-content/uploads/sponsors/)
4. Clear cache in the wordpress dashboard.
